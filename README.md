# Module-17-challenge

## Challenge Overview
For this challenge, we were tasked to analyze Amazon reviews in order to evaluate the performance of the Amazon Vine program, which incentivizes customer reviews. We specifically wanted to see how much the Vine program assist in getting 5 star reviews for products. To do so, we analyzed review data for Video Games on Amazon, and evaluated the amounts of paid and unpaid reviews, and their percentages of 5 star reviews.

## Results

First, we had to determine how many Vine Reviews and non Vine Reviews there were. 

There were, in total, 104 Vine reviews, and 65,275 non vine reviews.

There were 48 5 star paid vine reviews, at a percentage of 46%, and 20,439 unpaid vine reviews, at 31%. 

## Summary

Given that there is a smaller amount of paid vine reviews, and that they have a higher percentage of 5 star reviews, we can say that there does seem to be an effect, in that the quality of the reviews is likely to be higher if part of the paid vine program.

A further analysis would be to compare vine and non vine results for the same video game title- the same analysis we have done could be applied, but focused on a singular product. This will remove some variance due to personal customer opinion on the product, and give us a clearer idea of how the Vine program affects these reviews.
